# ðŸ“¥ `pyppbox-data`

* `pyppbox-data` can dynamically create individual data packages for the supported dectors/trackers/reiders of [`pyppbox`](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) V3 -> Learn more about the new structure of `pyppbox` V3 in the [official documentation](https://rathaumons.github.io/pyppbox/).

* `pyppbox-data` relies on its configurations inside [`setupconfig`](setupconfig) in order to create individual Python wheels.

* Only very minimal amount of the neccessary pretrained weight/model are included in the prebuilt `.whl` files -> Check [GitHub releases](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox-data/releases).

* The pretrained weight/model files are not included in this GitHub repo as they are big and totally consume over 1 GB of storage space.
