# ðŸ“¥ `pyppbox-data`

* `pyppbox-data` can dynamically create individual data packages of the supported dectors/trackers/reiders for [`pyppbox V3`](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox) -> Learn more about [the new structure here](https://rathaumons.github.io/pyppbox/pyppbox/structure.html).

* `pyppbox-data` relies on the configurations inside [`setupconfig`](setupconfig) in order to create individual Python wheels.

* Only a few pretrained weight/model files are included in the prebuilt `.whl` [files on GitHub releases](https://github.com/rathaumons/pyppbox-data/releases).

* The pretrained weight/model files are not included in the repo as they are too big (Over 1GB).
